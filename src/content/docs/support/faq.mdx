:::note
The following questions & answers apply to CachyOS and Arch Based distributions.
:::

## Installation

### Why is KDE Plasma the only available option in the live environment?

KDE Plasma can be considered as our "flagship" desktop environment, therefore it gets the most maintenance. The other CachyOS's ISO
were maintained in a half-ass state, so to avoid any unwanted issue & inconveniences for the user if at all, we decided to deprecate them so that we can focus our efforts to deliver
the best user experience.

We recommend installing CachyOS in a VM for testing out different desktop environments and window managers as the live ISO is only
used for installation and recovering a broken install via [cachy-chroot](https://github.com/CachyOS/cachy-chroot).

### When i press "Launch Installer" nothing seems to happen...?

:::caution
Make sure you have an active/running internet connection, otherwise nothing will happen after you press this button
:::

While it might seem like nothing happened, in the background there is a script which gets triggered after pressing this button. And what does it do? Well it's running a script for preparation that is  intended to avoid possible issues such as having an outdated keyring.

I'll give you an small heads up on what this [script](https://github.com/CachyOS/CachyOS-Live-ISO/blob/master/archiso/airootfs/usr/local/bin/calamares-online.sh) is doing on the background:

<Steps>

1. Removes the existing keyring file found in `/etc/pacman.d/gnupg`.
2. Starts installing and updating both `Arch Linux & CachyOS keyring packages`.
3. Initiates and populates pacman keyring.
4. Enables network time synchronization to ensure the system clock is accurate executing `timedatectl set-ntp true`.
5. Determines and checks if the system type is either **UEFI or BIOS/MBR**
6. If the running system is **UEFI** > prompt the user to select a bootloader, otherwise don't.

</Steps>

**This is why it usually takes a bit of time to load the installer.**

### My installation process got stuck in 33% for a while now.

This means that your internet connection is either very slow or unstable causing pacman to struggle when downloading the packages.

## Software management

### How can I fix the "unable to lock database" error in CachyOS?
```sh
sudo rm /var/lib/pacman/db.lck
```
:::tip
You can achieve the same outcome by using **"Remove db lock"** function in `CachyOS Hello` in the **Apps/Tweaks** tab.

### How can I fix possible keyring issues in CachyOS?

```text
# Example:
:: File /var/cache/pacman/pkg/python-charset-normalizer-3.4.0-1-any.pkg.tar.zst
is corrupted (invalid or corrupted package (PGP signature)).
```

```sh title='Run the following commands'
sudo rm -rf /etc/pacman.d/gnupg/
sudo pacman-key --init
sudo pacman-key --populate

sudo pacman-key --recv-keys F3B607488DB35A47 --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com
sudo pacman-key --lsign-key F3B607488DB35A47

sudo rm -R /var/lib/pacman/sync
```

### How can I remove those annoying warnings while updating my system? Is it safe to update the system when this happens?

#### Example:

<br />
<ImageComponent imgsrc={import('~/assets/images/update-warnings.png')} />

**Yes, it is safe to update the system.**

*To remove these errors, run the following command:*
```sh
sudo pacman -Syuu
```

### When trying to install a package with pacman i received the following error

```text
# Example
sudo pacman -S telegram-desktop
resolving dependencies...
looking for conflicting packages...

Packages (4) libdbusmenu-qt5-0.9.3+16.04.20160218-5  qt5-imageformats-5.15.2-1
             ttf-opensans-1.101-2  telegram-desktop-2.5.1-1

Total Download Size:   24.10 MiB
Total Installed Size:  67.51 MiB

:: Proceed with installation? [Y/n] Y
:: Retrieving packages...
error: failed retrieving file 'telegram-desktop-2.5.1-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst' from archlinux.mailtunnel.eu : The requested URL returned error: 404
```

This means that your local database is outdated therefore the package you're asking for can't be downloaded. Run the following command to refresh the package database and do a full upgrade:

```sh
sudo pacman -Syu
# Then try to install the package you want again.
```

### What does -bin means at the end of a package name? For example librewolf-bin

This means that you're downloading/installing a prebuilt package therefore you don't need to compile or build it.
In our repositories we store some bin packages which are basically mirrors that you can download from the AUR.

### When I try to open Discord, a window opens notifying me of an update

#### Example:

<br />
<ImageComponent imgsrc={import('~/assets/images/discord-update.png')} />

This is because Discord released an update that is yet not available or it hasn't been built in any of the pacman mirrors, therefore you get stuck
unable to use Discord.

In order to get around this issue, follow [Arch Wiki's fix guide](<https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Discord#Discord_asks_for_an_update_not_yet_available_in_the_repository>).


### I got an error while trying to clear pacman cache

:::tip
You can also clean the pacman cache using CachyOS Hello in **Apps/Tweaks** > **Clear package cache**
:::

#### Example:

<br />
<ImageComponent imgsrc={import('~/assets/images/pacman-cache-error.png')} />

*This usually appears when they're some orphans packages left in `/var/cache/pacman/pkg` which pacman can't delete.*

```sh title='Run the following command to fix it'
# Removes all the orphans stored in pkg cache.
sudo rm -r /var/cache/pacman/pkg/*
```

### I got this nvidia module error when I tried to update my system.

```text
==> ERROR: module not found: 'nvidia'
==> ERROR: module not found: 'nvidia_modeset'
==> ERROR: module not found: 'nvidia_uvm'
==> ERROR: module not found: 'nvidia_drm'
```

**Two reasons for this error:**

**1) Since Early Module Loading is always enabled in chwd, mkinitcpio consistently expects the presence of NVIDIA modules therefore this error arises when these modules are missing.**

**2) You might be missing NVIDIA modules from other installed kernels on your system.**

```sh title='Install the following package to fix this error'
sudo pacman -S nvidia
```

## Cachy Browser

### Why this browser keeps deleting my saved credentials and cookies?

- *This is because the browser comes with the option `Delete cookies and site data when Cachy Browser is closed` turned on by default.*
  - **Follow the screenshot showing where to disable it:**
    <br />
    <ImageComponent imgsrc={import('~/assets/images/cachy-browser-cookies.png')} />

### Websites are not following the dark theme preference from the browser.

- *This "issue" comes from the `privacy.resistFingerprinting` feature from Firefox. While it improves privacy, it also has its drawbacks such as websites not following the appearance preference.*
  - **Follow the screenshot showing where to disable it:**
    <br />
    <ImageComponent imgsrc={import('~/assets/images/cachy-browser-resist-fingerprint.png')} />
  - *After disabling this parameter. Restart your browser and try again.*

### GitHub Homepage makes the browser unusable and extremely slow.

- *Cachy Browser due to it's nature of leaning towards privacy. Disables WebGL by default and GitHub depends on it for rendering their homepage*
  - **Re-enable it as shown in the screenshot**
    <br />
    <ImageComponent imgsrc={import('~/assets/images/cachy-browser-webgl.png')} />
  - *After disabling this parameter. Restart your browser and try again.*

### Your browser is being managed by your organization. Do i need to worry?

- *No. This is because we include a [policies file](https://github.com/CachyOS/CachyOS-Browser-Settings/blob/master/distribution/policies.json) on which we disable features and add modifications to the browser. Example: `additional search engines.`*

### Some keyboard combinations are not working in certain websites like Photopea

- *This "issue" comes from the `privacy.resistFingerprinting` feature from Firefox.
  - **Follow the screenshot showing where to disable it:**
    <br />
    <ImageComponent imgsrc={import('~/assets/images/cachy-browser-resist-fingerprint.png')} />
  - *After disabling this parameter. Restart your browser and the keyboard combinations should work again.*
  - *Extra tip: Search for `webgl.disabled` and set it to `false`to take advantage of an improved Hardware Acceleration in Photopea.*
