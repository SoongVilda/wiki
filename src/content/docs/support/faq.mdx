:::note
The following questions & answers apply to CachyOS and Arch Based distributions.
:::

## Installation

### Why is KDE Plasma the only available option in the live environment?

KDE Plasma can be considered as our "flagship" desktop environment, therefore it gets the most maintenance. The other CachyOS's ISO
were maintained in a half-ass state, so to avoid any unwanted issue & inconveniences for the user if at all, we decided to deprecate them so that we can focus our efforts to deliver
the best user experience.

We recommend installing CachyOS in a VM for testing out different desktop environments and window managers as the live ISO is only
used for installation and recovering a broken install via [cachy-chroot](https://github.com/CachyOS/cachy-chroot).

### When i press "Launch Installer" nothing seems to happen...?

:::caution
Make sure you have an active/running internet connection, otherwise nothing will happen after you press this button
:::

While it might seem like nothing happened, in the background there is a script which gets triggered after pressing this button. And what does it do? Well it's running a script for preparation that is  intended to avoid possible issues such as having an outdated keyring.

I'll give you an small heads up on what this [script](https://github.com/CachyOS/CachyOS-Live-ISO/blob/master/archiso/airootfs/usr/local/bin/calamares-online.sh) is doing on the background:

<Steps>

1. Removes the existing keyring file found in `/etc/pacman.d/gnupg`.
2. Starts installing and updating both `Arch Linux & CachyOS keyring packages`.
3. Initiates and populates pacman keyring.
4. Enables network time synchronization to ensure the system clock is accurate executing `timedatectl set-ntp true`.
5. Determines and checks if the system type is either **UEFI or BIOS/MBR**
6. If the running system is **UEFI** > prompt the user to select a bootloader, otherwise don't.

</Steps>

**This is why it usually takes a bit of time to load the installer.**

### My installation process got stuck in 33% for a while now.

This means that your internet connection is either very slow or unstable causing pacman to struggle when downloading the packages.

## Software management

### "unable to lock database" error
```sh
sudo rm /var/lib/pacman/db.lck
```
:::tip
You can achieve the same outcome by using **"Remove db lock"** function in `CachyOS Hello` in the **Apps/Tweaks** tab.
:::

### File is corrupted (invalid or corrupted package (PGP signature))

```text
# Example:
:: File /var/cache/pacman/pkg/python-charset-normalizer-3.4.0-1-any.pkg.tar.zst
is corrupted (invalid or corrupted package (PGP signature)).
```

```sh title='Run the following commands'
sudo rm -rf /etc/pacman.d/gnupg/
sudo pacman-key --init
sudo pacman-key --populate

sudo pacman-key --recv-keys F3B607488DB35A47 --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com
sudo pacman-key --lsign-key F3B607488DB35A47

sudo rm -R /var/lib/pacman/sync
```

### warning local is newer than

#### Example:

<br />
<ImageComponent imgsrc={import('~/assets/images/update-warnings.png')} />

```sh title='To remove these warnings, execute the following command:'
sudo pacman -Syuu
```

### error: failed retrieving file, The requested URL returned error: 404

```text
# Example
sudo pacman -S telegram-desktop
resolving dependencies...
looking for conflicting packages...

Packages (4) libdbusmenu-qt5-0.9.3+16.04.20160218-5  qt5-imageformats-5.15.2-1
             ttf-opensans-1.101-2  telegram-desktop-2.5.1-1

Total Download Size:   24.10 MiB
Total Installed Size:  67.51 MiB

:: Proceed with installation? [Y/n] Y
:: Retrieving packages...
error: failed retrieving file 'telegram-desktop-2.5.1-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst'
from archlinux.mailtunnel.eu : The requested URL returned error: 404
```

*This means that your local database is outdated therefore the package you're asking for can't be downloaded.*

```sh title='Run the following command to refresh the package database and do a full upgrade:'
sudo pacman -Syu
# Then try to install the package you want again.
```

### Mirror issues

#### Slow package downloads or connection errors

```text
# Example errors:
error: failed retrieving file '...' from ... : Connection timed out
error: failed retrieving file '...' from ... : Couldn't resolve host name  
error: failed retrieving file '...' from ... : The requested URL returned error: 526
```

These errors typically indicate issues with your current mirrors - they might be slow, unreachable, or having temporary problems.

```sh title='Run the following command to get faster and more reliable mirrors:'
sudo cachyos-rate-mirrors
# Afterwards you can update your system with:
sudo pacman -Syu
```

:::tip
The `cachyos-rate-mirrors` command tests available CachyOS mirrors based on speed and synchronization status, then updates your mirror list file (`/etc/pacman.d/cachyos-mirrorlist`) with the best-performing ones.

Consider running it periodically, especially if you notice slowdowns during system updates.
:::

### What does -bin means at the end of a package name? For example librewolf-bin

This means that you're downloading/installing a prebuilt package therefore you don't need to compile or build it.
In our repositories we store some bin packages which are basically mirrors that you can download from the AUR.

### When I try to open Discord, a window opens notifying me of an update

#### Example:

<br />
<ImageComponent imgsrc={import('~/assets/images/discord-update.png')} />

This is because Discord released an update that is yet not available or it hasn't been built in any of the pacman mirrors, therefore you get stuck
unable to use Discord.

In order to get around this issue, follow [Arch Wiki's fix guide](<https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Discord#Discord_asks_for_an_update_not_yet_available_in_the_repository>).


### error: could not remove /var/cache/pacman/pkg/download

:::tip
You can also clean the pacman cache using CachyOS Hello in **Apps/Tweaks** > **Clear package cache**
:::

#### Example:

<br />
<ImageComponent imgsrc={import('~/assets/images/pacman-cache-error.png')} />

*This usually appears when they're some orphans packages left in `/var/cache/pacman/pkg` which pacman can't delete.*

```sh title='Run the following command to fix it'
# Removes all the orphans stored in pkg cache.
sudo rm -r /var/cache/pacman/pkg/*
```

### ERROR: module not found: 'nvidia', 'nvidia_modeset', 'nvidia_uvm', 'nvidia_drm'

```sh title='Example'
==> ERROR: module not found: 'nvidia'
==> ERROR: module not found: 'nvidia_modeset'
==> ERROR: module not found: 'nvidia_uvm'
==> ERROR: module not found: 'nvidia_drm'
```

**Two reasons for this error:**

**1) Since Early Module Loading is always enabled in chwd, mkinitcpio consistently expects the presence of NVIDIA modules therefore this error arises when these modules are missing.**

**2) You might be missing NVIDIA modules from other installed kernels on your system.**

```sh title='Install the following package to fix this error'
sudo pacman -S nvidia
```

## Cachy Browser (Deprecated)

### Migrating Your Profile from Cachy Browser to Firefox

Cachy Browser is based on Firefox (via LibreWolf), so migrating your profile, including history, bookmarks, extensions, and settings, to the standard Firefox is generally possible by copying the profile directory. However, always back up your data before proceeding.

There are a few methods, ranging from a full profile copy to using sync or manual transfer.

**Important First Step: Back Up Your Profiles!**

Before you start, it's crucial to back up both your Cachy Browser profile and your Firefox profile (if you have existing data you want to keep). This way, you can restore them if something goes wrong. Simply copy the entire profile folders (locations described below) to a safe place.

#### Method 1: Direct Profile Copy

This method attempts to copy *everything* from your Cachy Browser profile to Firefox. It's the most likely way to transfer all settings and extension data but carries a small risk of minor incompatibilities.

1.  **Locate Your Cachy Browser Profile Folder:**
    *   Open Cachy Browser.
    *   Type `about:profiles` in the address bar and press Enter.
    *   Find the profile currently in use (it usually says "This is the profile in use...").
    *   Click the "Open Directory" button next to the "Root Directory". This will open the folder containing your profile data.
    *   Alternatively, you can use `about:support` and find the "Profile Directory" entry.
    *   **Typical Location:** `~/.cachy/<profile_name>/`. The `<profile_name>` is usually a random string followed by `.default` or similar.

2.  **Locate Your Firefox Profile Folder:**
    *   Open Firefox.
    *   Type `about:profiles` in the address bar and press Enter.
    *   Find the profile you want to migrate *to*. If it's a fresh Firefox installation, there will likely be only one default profile.
    *   Click its "Open Directory" button.
    *   **Typical Location:** `~/.mozilla/firefox/<profile_name>/`

3.  **Close Both Browsers:** Ensure Cachy Browser and Firefox are completely closed.

4.  **Copy and Replace:**
    *   Go to the Cachy Browser profile folder you opened in Step 1. Select *all* the files and folders inside it (`Ctrl+A`).
    *   Copy these files (`Ctrl+C`).
    *   Go to the Firefox profile folder you opened in Step 2.
    *   **Delete** all the existing files and folders inside the Firefox profile folder. (This is why the backup is important!).
    *   Paste the files you copied from the Cachy Browser profile folder (`Ctrl+V`).

5.  **Launch Firefox and Verify:**
    *   Start Firefox. It should now load with your Cachy Browser bookmarks, history, extensions, and settings.
    *   Check your bookmarks, history, and especially your extensions.

6.  **Troubleshooting:**
    *   **Extensions:** Some extensions might require reconfiguration or might not work if they were specific Cachy Browser versions or relied on features not in standard Firefox. You may need to reinstall them from the official Firefox Add-ons store.
    *   **Privacy Settings:** Cachy Browser had stricter privacy settings enabled by default (similar to LibreWolf). Review Firefox's privacy and security settings (`about:preferences#privacy`) and adjust them to your liking.
    *   **Firefox Doesn't Start:** If Firefox fails to start or behaves strangely, your Cachy profile might have had an incompatibility. Restore your backed-up Firefox profile. You can then try Method 2 or 3, or try copying only specific files (like `places.sqlite` for bookmarks/history, `logins.json` for passwords, `prefs.js` for settings - though this is more advanced).

#### Method 2: Using Firefox Sync

If Cachy Browser supports Firefox Sync and you have it enabled, this is an easier way to transfer core data.

1.  **Enable Sync in Cachy Browser:**
    *   Go to Cachy Browser's settings (`about:preferences`).
    *   Find the "Sync" section.
    *   Sign in with your Firefox Account (or create one).
    *   Choose the data you want to sync (Bookmarks, History, Passwords, Extensions, Settings, Open Tabs).
    *   Allow Cachy Browser time to fully sync the data to the server.

2.  **Enable Sync in Firefox:**
    *   Open Firefox.
    *   Go to Settings (`about:preferences`) > Sync.
    *   Sign in with the *same* Firefox Account.
    *   Ensure the data types you want are selected for syncing.
    *   Allow Firefox time to download the synced data.

3.  **Limitations:** Firefox Sync is great for core data but often doesn't sync extension *settings* or *data*, and might not sync *all* browser preferences (`about:config` changes). You'll likely need to reconfigure extensions and some specific browser settings manually.

#### Method 3: Manual Data Transfer (Selective)

If the above methods fail or you only want specific data:

1.  **Bookmarks:**
    *   In Cachy Browser: Go to Bookmarks > Manage Bookmarks (or `Ctrl+Shift+O`). Click "Import and Backup" > "Export Bookmarks to HTML...". Save the file.
    *   In Firefox: Go to Bookmarks > Manage Bookmarks. Click "Import and Backup" > "Import Bookmarks from HTML...". Select the file you saved.
2.  **Passwords:**
    *   In Cachy Browser: Go to Passwords (`about:logins`). Click the three-dots menu (...) and choose "Export Passwords...". Save the `.csv` file (be aware this file is unencrypted).
    *   In Firefox: Go to Passwords (`about:logins`). Click the three-dots menu (...) and choose "Import from a File...". Select the `.csv` file. Delete the `.csv` file securely afterwards.
3.  **Extensions & Settings:** You will need to manually reinstall extensions from the Firefox Add-ons store and reconfigure browser settings in `about:preferences`.

Choose the method that best suits your needs. Method 1 is usually the most complete if it works without issues.

### Why this browser keeps deleting my saved credentials and cookies?

- *This is because the browser comes with the option `Delete cookies and site data when Cachy Browser is closed` turned on by default.*
  - **Follow the screenshot showing where to disable it:**
    <br />
    <ImageComponent imgsrc={import('~/assets/images/cachy-browser-cookies.png')} />

### GitHub Homepage makes the browser unusable and extremely slow.

- *Cachy Browser due to it's nature of leaning towards privacy. Disables WebGL by default and GitHub depends on it for rendering their homepage*
  - **Re-enable it as shown in the screenshot**
    <br />
    <ImageComponent imgsrc={import('~/assets/images/cachy-browser-webgl.png')} />
  - *After disabling this parameter. Restart your browser and try again.*
*This recommendation also applies to websites that takes advantage of Hardware Acceleration via WebGL such as Photopea.*

### Your browser is being managed by your organization. Do i need to worry?

- *No. This is because we include a [policies file](https://github.com/CachyOS/CachyOS-Browser-Settings/blob/master/distribution/policies.json) on which we disable features and add modifications to the browser. Example: `additional search engines.`*

### RFP (Resist Fingerprint Protection)

- Cachy Browser enables `privacy.resistFingerprinting` by default. While it improves privacy, it comes at the cost of some issues for users that are not aware such as the following ones:
  - Rendering artifacts
  - Dark theme not applying
  - Unable to login in certain websites (Twitch)
  - Some keybind combinations do not work

- To verify if this feature is the one causing the issue you are currently experiencing. Take a look to the following [Mozilla Article](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/resist-fingerprinting) and expand the **How might Resist Fingerprinting break web pages?** section.

*In order to disable RFP, go to `about:config` and search for **privacy.resistFingerprinting** and set it to `false`*
