title: AUR Safety - Quick Checklist for CachyOS Users
---

The AUR offers a vast selection, but security is paramount. Hereâ€™s a concise guide to safe AUR usage for your CachyOS system.

* **1. Understand the PKGBUILD:** It's the build script. Know its structure, variables (`source`, `pkgname`), and functions (`build()`, `package()`).
* **2. Verify Source Links:** Always check that `source` URLs point to official project sites or trusted repositories. Avoid suspicious or personal links.
* **3. Review Installation Steps:** Inspect where files are installed (`package()` function) and if any commands are unusual or touch sensitive system areas. Check `.install` scripts too.
* **4. Research the Maintainer:** Look into the maintainer's history on the AUR for any past security issues or suspicious activity.
* **5. Check Checksums & PGP:** Absolutely crucial! Confirm all checksums (SHA256, BLAKE2b, etc.) match upstream. Use PGP signatures (`validpgpkeys`) for authenticity when available.
* **6. Be Cautious with `-bin` Packages:** These use pre-compiled binaries, meaning you can't inspect the source. Apply maximum scrutiny to their origins and integrity.
* **7. Read Community Comments:** Check the AUR page comments for warnings, issues, or insights from other users.
* **8. Never Skip Integrity Checks:** Using `--skipinteg` or similar flags bypasses all security checks. Don't do it.
* **9. Control Your AUR Helper:** Understand how your helper (yay, paru) works. Ensure it shows you the PKGBUILD and its diffs, or build manually with `makepkg`.
* **10. Assess Necessity:** Before installing, ask if you truly need this AUR package, or if an official repo alternative exists.
* **11. Keep Your System Updated:** Regularly run `sudo pacman -Syu` to ensure all your system components, including `pacman` and `makepkg`, have the latest security patches.

Stay vigilant to keep your Arch-based system secure!
