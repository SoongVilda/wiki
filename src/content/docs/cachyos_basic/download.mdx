## Downloading ISO

CachyOS ISO can be obtained from the following sources:

*   [Website](<https://cachyos.org/download>)
*   [SourceForge](<https://sourceforge.net/projects/cachyos-arch/files/>)
*   [CachyOS Mirror](<https://mirror.cachyos.org/ISO/>)

## Verifying ISO integrity with SHA256

:::caution[WARNING]
Always take an extra step to verify the ISOs integrity to avoid any undesired issues at installation or while creating a bootable media.
:::

**Current ISO Version:** `241221`

**SHA256 Hash:** `6b6562602705da3228d9862d7016a00ca6fa482482b87fd15656f9b2793f4ef6`

<Steps>

1. Download the [file](https://mirror.cachyos.org/ISO/desktop/241221/cachyos-desktop-linux-241221.iso.sha256) containing the SHA256 hash **(Open it with a Text Editor e.g: Notepad).**
2. Open CMD or PowerShell as Administrator and [navigate](<https://www.wikihow.com/Change-Directories-in-Command-Prompt>) to the path where the ISO and SHA256 files are stored.
3. Execute the following command:
   ```powershell
   # Example:
   certUtil -hashfile cachyos-desktop-linux-241221.iso SHA256
   ```
4. Compare the certUtil hash output to the one from the downloaded file in **Step 1.** If they match, you can proceed with the CachyOS installation.

1. Download the [file](https://mirror.cachyos.org/ISO/desktop/241221/cachyos-desktop-linux-241221.iso.sha256) containing the SHA256 hash.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the `.sha256` file and execute the following commands:
   ```sh
   # Example:
   cd Downloads/
   cat cachyos-desktop-linux-241221.iso.sha256
   # 6b6562602705da3228d9862d7016a00ca6fa482482b87fd15656f9b2793f4ef6
   ```
3. Compare the output from **Step 2** and execute the following command to check what's the current hash in the ISO file.
   ```sh
   # Example:
   sha256sum cachyos-desktop-linux-241221.iso
   ```
4. If the hashes from **Step 2** and **Step 3** match, you can proceed with the CachyOS installation.

## Verify ISO Image Authenticity (Linux)

To verify the authenticity of the ISO file to be sure that the actual one has been released by the official CachyOS development team:

<Steps>

1. Import the GPG key for verifying the authenticity:

   ```shell
   gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --recv-key F3B607488DB35A47
   ```

2. Download the ISO file and its `.sig` signature file and run the following command (by replacing `full_iso_name.iso` with the actual ISO filename):
   ```shell
   gpg --verify full_iso_name.iso.sig full_iso_name.iso
   ```

   If you get a **Good signature** output, the ISO file is genuine:
   ```
   gpg: Signature made Mo 01 Apr 2024 14:13:30 CEST
   gpg:                using RSA key 882DCFE48E2051D48E2562ABF3B607488DB35A47
   gpg: Good signature from "CachyOS <admin@cachyos.org>" [unknown]
   gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
   gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
   Primary key fingerprint: 882D CFE4 8E20 51D4 8E25  62AB F3B6 0748 8DB3 5A47
   ```

</Steps>

:::danger
If the output does not return **Good signature** string or the key ID does not match, don't use the ISO image and make sure that the downloaded image comes
from a legitimate CachyOS source. A bad signature could suggest that the downloaded image has been tampered with.
