:::caution
Since Hyprland started their rework. Please be aware that it is not currently stable and you can experience bugs/unexpected crashes. Use at your own risk.
Even their "stable" version is also broken and buggy therefore we do not plan to provide support outside of our dotfiles. Refer to their [wiki](<https://wiki.hyprland.org/>) instead.
:::

:::tip
Start Hyprland using the non systemd entry otherwise it won't start and lead to a black screen.

Example: **`Hyprland`** instead of **`Hyprland(systemd)`**.
:::

Our main goal with our setup is to have a working Hyprland but keeping it simple therefore some essential tools and programs might be missing such as a GUI File Manager.

Take a look into our [Hyprland FAQ.](/desktop_environments/hyprland#faq)

## FAQ

### Why does my Discord, Thunar and Nautilus have a weird background?

This is because the window has a modified opacity

* Consider modifying the window rule in the [Hyprland](https://github.com/CachyOS/cachyos-hyprland-settings/blob/master/etc/skel/.config/hypr/config/windowrules.conf#L21) config file.

```sh title='Example'
windowrulev2 = opacity 0.92, class:^(thunar|nemo)$
```

### Is there a File Manager included?

* No, install one you like
