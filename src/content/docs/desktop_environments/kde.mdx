## FAQ

### How can i get the same look as the one shown in the KDE Screenshots? named as "Emerald"

- **It's a combination of the Emerald Theme + Qogir Icon Theme which they're not installed by default.**
  - ```sh title='Install both with the following command'
    sudo pacman -S cachyos-emerald-kde-theme-git qogir-icon-theme
    ```
  **Apply both in `Appearance & Style - Colors & Themes`.**

### Why does SDDM looks so bland and old?

- *Since there is no SDDM theme being applied by default. SDDM will fallback to the classic theme.*
  - **Apply the Breeze Theme as shown in the screenshot**
